[**Tobias Scheer**](http://sites.unice.fr/scheer/tobweb/) is Professor of Linguistics at CNRS' Bases, Corpus and Language Laboratory, at the University of Cote d'Azur. Almost all of my research interests are directly or indirectly inspired by his continuing contributions to linguistic theory, modularity of mind, and phonology as a theory of mental/neural representations and computations. I was fortunate enough to have Tobias as my supervisor, and that has made all the difference in my life. This description is short because he has worked on too many things of which I know and understand too little! My personal fascination with his works stems mostly from two related phenomena. First, Tobias is, perhaps, the most ardent proponent of modularity (qua modularity in the broader Cognitive Sciences) in phonological theory. Second, his ability to bridge the gap between psycholinguistic and linguistic theories, and to bring psycholinguistic investigations to bear upon phonological theory is, in my opinion, unparalleled. It helps, obviously, that he is the progenitor of phonolEEGy, and I am obsessed with the brain like a toddler with icecream! Follow the link to learn more about his work. And READ [**THE BLUE BOOK**](https://www.degruyter.com/document/doi/10.1515/9783110238631.bm/html)! Seriously... do it now!!!
