[**Jason Shaw**](https://ling.yale.edu/people/jason-shaw) is an Associate Professor of Linguistics and director of the Phonetics Laboratory. He received his PhD in linguistics from New York University in 2010. 
His research investigates how phonological form structures natural variation in speech and how this variation is interpreted by listeners. His approach combines 
language description with formal computational models and experimental methods that capture the temporal unfolding of speech planning, production, and perception. 
Experimental methods used in his research include eye-tracking in speech perception experiments and Electromagnetic Articulography (EMA) and ultrasound in speech production experiments. 
Before joining Yale in 2016, he did research in Australia supported by the Australian Research Council Discovery Early Career Research Award and in Japan supported by the 
Japan Society for the Promotion of Science and was a faculty member at Western Sydney University.
